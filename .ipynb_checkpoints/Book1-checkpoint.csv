the world.  i've lived in san francisco for 15 years, and both love it and find myself frustrated with its deficits. lots of great friends and acquaintances (which increases my apprehension to put anything on this site), but i'm feeling like meeting some new people that aren't just friends of friends. it's okay if you are a friend of a friend too. chances are, if you make it through the complex filtering process of multiple choice questions, lifestyle statistics, photo scanning, and these indulgent blurbs of text without moving quickly on to another search result, you are probably already a cultural peer and at most 2 people removed. at first, i thought i should say as little as possible here to avoid you, but that seems silly.  as far as culture goes, i'm definitely more on the weird side of the spectrum, but i don't exactly wear it on my sleeve. once you get me talking, it will probably become increasingly apparent that while i'd like to think of myself as just like everybody else (and by some definition i certainly am), most people don't see me that way. that's fine with me. most of the people i find myself gravitating towards are pretty weird themselves. you probably are too.","i make nerdy software for musicians, artists, and experimenters to indulge in their own weirdness, but i like to spend time away from the computer when working on my artwork (which is typically more concerned with group dynamics and communication, than with visual form, objects, or technology). i also record and deejay dance, noise, pop, and experimental music (most of which electronic or at least studio based). besides these relatively ego driven activities, i've been enjoying things like meditation and tai chi to try and gently flirt with ego death.","improvising in different contexts. alternating between being present and decidedly outside of a moment, or trying to hold both at once. rambling intellectual conversations that hold said conversations in contempt while seeking to find something that transcends them. being critical while remaining generous. listening to and using body language--often performed in caricature or large gestures, if not outright interpretive dance. dry, dark, and raunchy humor.","my large jaw and large glasses are the physical things people comment on the most. when sufficiently stimulated, i have an unmistakable cackle of a laugh. after that, it goes in more directions than i care to describe right now. maybe i'll come back to this.","okay this is where the cultural matrix gets so specific, it's like being in the crosshairs.  for what it's worth, i find myself reading more non-fiction than fiction. it's usually some kind of philosophy, art, or science text by silly authors such as ranciere, de certeau, bataille, baudrillard, butler, stein, arendt, nietzche, zizek, etc. i'll often throw in some weird new age or pop-psychology book in the mix as well. as for fiction, i enjoy what little i've read of eco, perec, wallace, bolao, dick, vonnegut, atwood, delilo, etc. when i was young, i was a rabid asimov reader.  directors i find myself drawn to are makavejev, kuchar, jodorowsky, herzog, hara, klein, waters, verhoeven, ackerman, hitchcock, lang, gorin, goddard, miike, ohbayashi, tarkovsky, sokurov, warhol, etc. but i also like a good amount of ""trashy"" stuff. too much to name.  i definitely enjoy the character development that happens in long form episodic television over the course of 10-100 episodes, which a 1-2hr movie usually can't compete with. some of my recent tv favorites are: breaking bad, the wire, dexter, true blood, the prisoner, lost, fringe.  a smattered sampling of the vast field of music i like and deejay: art ensemble, sun ra, evan parker, lil wayne, dj funk, mr. fingers, maurizio,

well, i believe that, especially in relationships, the problem is often too _little_ openness, so i am more into telling as much as possible as accurately as possible, and sooner rather than later. there are really only 2 reasons i keep secrets:  1. because they involve other people. unless i know they are ok with it, i try not to bandy about things that they would rather keep private.  2. because i want to keep it for later. for example, i am not going to tell you what is in your present until you've opened it.  as for all the weird and wonderful things i haven't told you yet...if you are interested, send me a message and start discovering! :-d","you should message me if...well, if you feel like it, really. there is no reason not to, really, unless you're really not interested in me at all. i love to get messages from people. :-d  some reasons you might want to message me (in no particular order):  - you live near me and would like to meet up. i like making new friends!  - i checked out your profile, but didn't write you a message. this probably means i intended to write to you, but lacked the time or was too tired. working full-time makes me that way. :-(  - you found something on my profile that you would like to talk about. for example, an interest we have in common, or something you agree or disagree with.  - you thought of a reason that you think should be listed here, but isn't."

 you appreciate the physical beauty of the human body. you are a very sensual being. human touch is very important. hugs, kisses, massage, and sex. people skirt around the topic of sex all the time, but lets face it, sex is a very important aspect of a relationship for someone like you or me and there's no point wasting our time in a situation where the sex is less than phenominal. i'm excited to hear about your turn-ons and fantasies.  money is not really an issue for you - not because you're obscenely rich, that's not really important. i just mean that you have no trouble making the life you want for yourself. you appreciate that we are a very gifted, fortunate people to live as we do.  you give back to this wonderful community you live in.  you love to keep in shape by doing things, as opposed to just going to the gym for an hour a day. mt biking, rock climbing, surfing, kite surfing, running, hiking, snowshoeing, telemark, snowboarding, road biking, swimming, tai chi, qigong, and yoga all sound interesting to you even though you haven't tried them all yet. maybe you won't even like all of them, but at least you're excited to give them all a try.  you are not a serial monogomist. you are independent and comfortable being alone. it's fun to date and meet new people, but you're not going to settle for anything less than you deserve. ultimately you crave a relationship you can commit to for the rest of your life. you are looking for a loving relationship based on good communication and trust.  eventually you might want a family, but you're in no hurry."

in a subtle ways for the most part. dry humour, sarcasm. i guess i just find humour/interest in many things that most people don't even notice. i'm quirky...but endearingly so (or so people say). i spend a lot of time looking for new (to me, anyway) music to add to my collection, looking for interesting events/activities/hobbies to try out around the city and revising mental maps of where i'd like to end up eventually. i love hunting for just the right vintage pieces. naturally, i'm an etsy whore, and can be found perusing vintage furniture stores, especially the alameda county antique fairs. my most recent vintage purchase was a gorgeous grundig majestic record console, i do believe it's my favourite piece of furniture i own now.  i like trying out cozy new places to eat, and new recipes, but i'm not by any stretch of the mind a 'foodie'. i frequent wine bars and coffee shops, bay area staples. i _love_ the beach...i totally appreciate being relatively close to the beach, after having lived in ny, where the beach was neither close to the city nor worthwhile. i like finding fun new ways of being active, like finding new trails to jog, paths to bike or walls to climb. going on spontaneous adventures is one of my favourite things to do, and a fun way to get to know people. i love all things creative, so art walks, gallery openings, live performances, museums, activities that involve creating art, are all places that i tend to gravitate towards...and i'm always looking for more people to that are also into these kinds of events.  i'm into technology, particularly mobile, which is the industry i work in. it's a long story as to how i got here, but it's where i want to be and i actually don't hate my job. i tweet and facebook. and read tech blogs like engadget and gigaom to keep up with the current goings on with the latest gadgets. but, i also read magazines like juxtapoz, big up, etc. because i love them and for the way it offsets the techier stuff in my line up.  when it comes to friends, i'm super loyal and i think respect is important. bad communication in any relationship, friendship or otherwise is the kiss of death in my opinion, and a personal pet peeve of mine. i like to be as up front as possible in most situations...even if that's not what the person wants to hear.  eventually, i'd love to settle down with someone who i really enjoy, respect, and feel a strong connection with. ideally, i'd like for that person to be pretty different from me, into their own scene, but still have some interests overlap with mine. i don't really like to rush into dating, but when i find someone i like, i tend to want to spend time, and get to know them. i'm a cuddler. and a hand holder. and a just because-er. and likely, a professional grade spooner. although dating-wise, this past year has been very mismatched for me, as it seems that i haven't been into the people that have been into me, and vice versa. hopefully eventually, a mutual dig will occur...i wouldn't settle for anything less.  things i <3. traveling, learning languages, hand-knit goods, mixed tapes, diptyque candles, architecture, good investments, creativity, ink, intelligent speculation, kindred souls, scorpios, animal rescue and rehabilitation, paths less traveled, documentaries, acoustic guitars, the beach, thunderstorms, cozy coffee shops, positivity, underdogs, survivors, deviation from the norm, any type of gadgetry esp mobile technology, boxee, twitter, etsy!, trader joes, interactive media, innovation, imported cars, ancient civilizations, good teachers  i am optimistic, quirky, and fun-loving","being in the moment as much as possible...taking my time to really internalize this, and all these amazing moments.  iteratively

deadboy, four tet, pariah, vvv, skream, scuba, george fitzgerald, jacques greene, little dragon, cocteau twins, washed out, beach house, warpaint, mumford & sons, tegan & sara, the cure, radiohead,

prefer it. ;)",friendship smartphone music the interwebz espresso perspective,"this changes on a daily basis. some days it's deep existential topics. others it's how to get my bangs to lay right.

and it is a huge adrenaline rush!!!,people always laugh when i tell them that i do have a shy side. it just doesn't show up until we get to know each other a little better. then the real me feels more vulnerable because now i know you are realizing if you really like who i am. that phase is usually brief then i'm comfortable and at ease. i have so many amazing friends i know there must be some reason why!,"i love the brain bending {science fiction} movies that are based on the writing of phillip k. dick. blade runner was the first. minority report, vanilla sky, the island, gattaca. star trek was awesome. another all time favorite was eternal sunshine of the spotless mind. fear and loathing in las vegas, real genius and better off dead from the 80's, airplane, i read a lot about consciousness and the influence of psychedelics in religion, psychology,spirituality and culture. if i were stranded on a desert island: thai food!!! although sushi might be more likely to be on the menu, and that's great too! malcom gladwell's books. freakonomics for comedy, [patton oswalt] is the grand high master of all that is funny. basically, comedy would probably be my favorite genre of movies.",my passport my free flight benefits my amazing friends and family my sense of humor and youthful spirit my ability to create and share a unique and colorful existence with this little speck of infinity i have somehow been blessed with i'm pretty attached to my iphone. okay very. but i do admit to a fair amount of droid envy.,"*when and where i am going to go next. and how i am going to afford it!

*shamanism. how ancient plant medicine healers still connect to the wisdom of the living world around us. i think we have forgotten ancient wisdom. *i love learning about the psychedelic revolution of the 60's and how it did and didn't change the world. how the present day is different a a result. i just had the honor of meeting one of the great psychedelic chemists of all time. that was more exciting than any movie star for me. let's just say if you've ever felt ""ecstatic"", he is why. i am a member of a non-profit organization called maps, which is devoted to legal research, such as mdma based therapy for ptsd. good work! *psychology. why we behave the way we do. why it is so hard to change, even when the change is for a far greater good. why we love who we love. *but here, in the physical realm, i really think a lot about the vast amount of plastic junk that just gets dumped into our landfills and oceans over the generations. why do we need to buy all this stupid stuff? how can it be better managed? is this planet really as different from when i was a child as they say in terms of extinctions and habitat destruction? *couchsurfing! or more specifically couchsurfing.org. a website that i truly feel has changed and revolutionized global travel and community in profound and as yet unknown ways. i am blessed to have the founders of this world altering site as my dear friends even though my begging to be of service to them has gone unheeded!",surrounded by some incredibly wonderful people that i am truly blessed to call my friends. we have a great community that we all feel lucky to be a part of.,sapiosexual. i have a little bit of a genius fetish. smart is very sexy!,"you are passionate about massage!

[ok fine- andrew bird and israel kaanoi kamakawiwoole.]  the town about bank robbers and good will hunting about a boy genius are favorites and i saw the fighter and liked it. i enjoy deep moral-of-the-story cinema and action like the latest batman movies, goofball like trading places. i liked punch drunk love, hearts in atlantis and thunderheart most of all. meet joe black was quite interesting- i enjoyed the metaphysical conceit and the performances. ummm... even though i've seen them so many times it's hard to count, i may still be able to watch shawshank, the green mile or dances with wolves again. we'll just have to wait and see. i enjoy any movie that's got one or two of a few dozen actors/essess in it and i watch all kinds of documentaries on the netflix site.  i also like and eat food- especially thai, indian, or russian roots-style and the like. i meat eat but would like to phase more to the other side... i'm having a hard time, recently, reconciling my salivation response and appetite with my love of all teh cute, beautiful animals in the world- and the environment and stuff. generally, i steer towards things i can both identify and, if pressed, easily describe without suspecting that continuous consumption would make 7 in 10 people sick. the way i heard it, you've only got one body so treating it well seems best.","*mila the (lone) cat. just like many other people who have pets i think mine has special qualities and feel fortunate to be her friend.  *the car. my love affair with personal transport started early; i still feel lucky to be able to go somewhere the moment i have the desire. it's a luxury i don't take for granted.  *6 hours of sleep. any less and i get fuzzy around the edges and look all merle haggard. while staying up all night has a lot going for it when in good company or getting all 'task master' on some project, i know too much about how lack of sleep makes me feel to ignore this too often.  *good friends.... familiar ""well, duh"" factor, i know. honestly though, people i love who i haven't even met yet make me happy- and the ones i may never see again do too.  *a down comforter and soft sheets.

college. university. decisions.","apparently filling out essays on okcupid when i should probably be studying for finals. this is a social activity though, so i'm counting it towards my allotted socialization time. oh, wait, you said typical. same thing i do every night, try to take over the world. i try not to study too much on fridays, if at all. so i'm probably playing with my dog, sophie and/or hanging out with my cat. i might also be at my best friend's house, watching a movie or snuggling with a lizard. dinner with my parents is also a common activity. it all depends on my mood that day :)","i am a giant dork. wait. that's common knowledge. uhhhh... my sock collection is quite impressive and i'm proud of it. it's not super unusual for me to spend nearly $100 on a sock order from my favorite sock website. i have a favorite sock website, that might be enough for this box.","you want to. i'm decently awesome if you bother to take the time to get to know me. i do however make random noises from time to time, so the easily startled or embarrassed need not apply. if you hate animals, dislike gay people, are generally a jack wagon, or are just going to say something lame like ""hey baby, we should have sex"" you probably shouldn't bother since i'll just ignore you or get violently angry in your general direction, and no one wants to see that."

will be moving to san francisco on august 1st, 2012. presently i live in mountain view, so it is not much of a hike to meet new folks in ""the city"" as it stands already. standard profile begins...now:  i am a hopeless romantic. i really try to believe the best in everyone, and i hope for the best in myself. i regularly tell people i am the luckiest person i know.  i use 1980's phrases like ""keen"", ""rad"" and ""badass"", and i am told i have a rather peculiar vernacular. i really enjoy talking...in fact if i am nervous i talk even more. i really love useless, but interesting trivia.  i adore traveling and taking risks as much as possible. i enjoy the rush i get by being pulled out of my comfort zones as well. my favorite places i have visited are paris, dubrovnik, sicily and hong kong. i have lived in richmond, va, baltimore, md, right outside of dc (gaithersburg), and now silicon valley.  i am actually an introvert, but being in high-end sales and acquisitions for years, i have learned how to carry on engaging conversations with practically anyone, so most people actually think i am super extroverted.  sarcasm is a critical part of my life, and i greatly value wit and cleverness. i enjoy ""creative swearing""... anyone can say ""shit"", but ""misanthropic fuck-tard"" is a lot more amusing, and most likely more appropriate.  i am fascinated by robots, museums and multi-hour conversations. my favorite video games are galaga and mario kart 64. i love roller-coasters and people who smile all of the time. i can be very easily convinced to go see or do something just because it's weird or new. i have dark auburn hair, am left handed, and i am an only child. i have been in the bay area for about 6 months and on the rare occasion i have a drink at a bar, it is typically a double shot of well tequila on the rocks, no lime or salt. i am very easily distracted by shiny objects, and i think i am totally awesome-sauce.","i have moved out to the bay area from richmond, va...where i still remotely operate that state's comicon (nerdy!). i am still doing some publishing work in comics.  summer 2012 update: just finished publsihing a tmnt comic, and i am working on some robert crumb recipe cards to debut at the san diego comic-con in july. i will be moving from mountain view to san francisco on august 1st, 2012.  since moving to the bay are in summer of 2011, i have worked hard to lose weight...i got over 200 lbs (holy poop!) 2 years ago, but now i am back in the 170s. i really like taking walks, especially with my mutt, who has adorable heterochromia iridium (which, i am told, is a very groovy mutation).  previous gigs include television and radio voice-over work, graphic design, being a multi-spoken-language database admin, director of a failed dot-com (had to testify in front of senate for that one), being the #1 seller of comic books in the world on ebay, and acting as a primary vintage jewelry buyer for the highest rated jewerly store in central virginia. seriously.","building intricate stuff with a finite amount of steps. think...ikea furniture or legos. i believe i am fairly good at seeing the ""big picture"" of

only one laughing.","i have a very unique timbre to my voice. it is not unsettling, but even at normal volumes it has a way of slicing through ambient sounds. if i am in a room with 20 people, and

whatever pandora throws at me...stations include: save ferris, pink floyd, moe., bollywood, explosions in the sky, adele, rush, slough feg, john williams and johnny cash.  tv shows: afv, mxc, snl, st: voyager, the league, it's always sunny, firefly, eastbound. i don't have cable, and have to hook my computer up to an old projector to watch any tv, so i usually only get about an hour of television in a week, typically downloaded and zero ads. hated ads ever since i won a tivo in an essay contest back in 2000.","1) bay area burritos 2) my mom and grandma (awww) 3) my ugly dog and remembering his

turn off the alarm clock so i can sleep until lunchtime on saturday. dining out is pretty neat. i also have a bunch of super-smart friends who slum it with me, and remind me of how peculiar california can really be.  my idea of a great date is a 6 hour conversation with zero pretense, comfy shoes and possibly skee-ball or mini-golf. i'm not really a ""club-hopping"" person, but honestly don't mind if you are. i actually like to be left the hell alone sometimes, so i can walk around in my underwear and read cracked.com like it's important journalism.","i'm lactose intolerant. thankfully i can

lol they don't need a dad but someone that is teen-friendly would be a welcome addition to my life. anyway back to the soulmate thing. sometimes you just meet someone and everything is so easy and just falls into place effortlessly. the problem with that is sometimes it's so easy you forget to view the red flags and warning signs. i would like to meet someone and keep my eyes open but still have the pieces fit together like that. i'm not a person that really has favorites. there are a few categories of things (movies for example) where i do have some favorites but overall i might have a consuming interest in something one year and the next year i'll be on to something else. i definitely don't have a favorite song or color or day of the week or anything like that. this makes me more flexible to be open-minded as to my partner's interests but i have enough things that interest me and enough life-long friends that i won't try to lose myself in the other person's life but still have my own interests as well. i wouldn't want to be with someone that requires so much ""alone"" time though that we don't have enough time together. okay that was rambling but i hope i've said a little about myself at least to give you an idea of, if not who i am, then, who i would like to be with lol some interests: reading spoken word poetry (hearing) comedy shows live music hanging out with friends and family going to the movies surfing the 'net' travel  i am awake, aware, and significant",spending far too much time trying to tactfully tell people that the word they are looking for is converse and not conversate.,"spelling, listening, learning.",if they met me on the internet first it's usually that my pics don't do me justice. seriously i've heard that a few times. in person...my smile or my birthmark...depends on the person i guess...,"i can give you genres but i'm not a person that has true favorites. something may be my favorite at the time and then i may not be able to recall the title or author at a later date.  books: most sci-fi although fantasy not-so-much. stephen king. i will read non-fiction (e.g. self-help) occasionally. urban fiction.  movies: everything with the exception of that goofy/slapstick type comedy and no extreme horror.  music: i like music. i like going to see live music. i like dancing sometimes. i don't love music like i have to hear it daily or it has to be on whenever i'm in the car and i don't really have too many favorite artists or bands. i guess i like mostly neo-soul, old-school r & b, gospel, christian, and ""other"" as far as genres i listen to most often. by ""other"" i mean that i like random songs from probably almost every genre of music except death metal or something like that.  food: i'm adventurous when it comes to food although i really have never liked most morrocan or indian foods and i rarely, if ever, eat pork. i like some italian dishes but not a huge fan of pasta. other than that i'm open to all types i like ethiopian, other african foods, thai, etc.","god, family & friends, affection, passion, books, iphone and i have to add in my dvr ;)",everything. i think i have add my mind thinks about all kinds of different things all the time. i have to tell it to be quiet.,"lately i've been at home *gasp* lazing around watching tv or being on the internet. i have been reading more lately again. when i read a book i devour it. i can't stand to put it down and have to read it all the way to the end even if i stay up until the wee hours of the night. i go through phases. sometimes i'm running around all over the place, doing this, doing that, never being home and then other times it's like im in hibernation mode. right now i'm hibernating and occasionally i break free!",i actually watch the mindless entertainment we call television sometimes and it makes me laugh. i don't have to say i watch it on hulu or online so that i'm different from the rest of the sheep either lol,"you would like to get to know me better you're single and available you're easy-going, talkative and patient you desire a friendship that could lead to a long-term romantic liason"

(does anyone count these six things? message or im me if someone has ever corrected your seven-list, or grammar, or punctuation - i'm just curious, because i sometimes get the urge to fix someone's comma splices or obvious misspellings and malaprops, but then i think to myself that if it mattered to them, they'd run the spellchecker before submitting it, and then i'm just the fastidious idiot fussing over nothing).","neurological functions (synapse repair & proliferation, neurotransmitter pathways, how to make my brain work better & smarter).  what i'm going to do with the rest of my life (what i want to do for money, where i want to be, physically & otherwise, in 5 years, how to live in such a way that when i look back at 85 i'm happy with my choices).  now - or rather, not thinking about now, but being in it.","swing dancing at a ballroom, or at a bar or a show with friends. i don't tend to drink much, but i tend to like hanging out with people who do (go figure), so it works out well enough anyway.  as an aside, i'm amused at how many people won't admit to having a ""typical friday night"" to write about -- at a certain level, i think it bespeaks a little bit of denial (that you're as knowable as everyone else) or perhaps a lack of self-knowledge/self-examination if you can't look back & recognize your patterns; contrariwise, if you truly have no patterns, that is in itself a little odd to me. i don't mind if your pattern is ""go out & do something that i've never done before"" or even ""write a numbered list of the top results from a google search of sf activities this weekend ... and then roll a 20-sided die"" but i suspect if you actually look at your life, there probably is a pattern.

and i really miss sharing the journey through life, and all the little and big ways that a relationship adds to my life.  on first dates, i'm often told that i'm really easy to talk with and very easy to be with. i suppose this is largely because i've grown quite comfortable with myself and who i am. i've worked on myself a lot for over 3 decades, and, while still/always a work-in-progress, i've come a long way in myself and in my life. i'm happy and i enjoy life. also, i have a lot of interests, i listen well and converse easily. i'm very curious about people and mostly non-judgmental.  those that know me describe me as very kind, feminine, extremely sweet, soft yet strong, gentle and firm, very present, calm, grounded, compassionate, lively, passionate, insightful, relaxed, very affectionate, interesting, super bright, curious, funny, multi-talented and creative, nurturing, generous, fun, and spontaneous...... though usually not all in the same sentence. i'm intense at times, but in a good way. men often ask me how it's possible that i'm unattached. those that know me really well would add that i'm wise, exceptionally sensitive, intuitive, and a bit of a sprite. you'll know i'm comfortable with you when you get to experience the sprite in me. :)  i have a huge heart and love full out. hopefully, you do too. that's where the 2heartsdelight happens. you'd need to be ok with being loved completely.  i have a very curious mind. i ask a lot of questions- not all of them aloud. i'm told i ask great questions. and, i don't have a need to always have conversation in the company of another. i'm fine with just being especially once we know each other a bit and are comfortable with each other.  i've developed awfully good communication skills and excellent relationship skills. men in recent years have found me rather remarkable in this way and in other ways too. i hold up my end of a partnership/relationship rather well and can let you have your experience w/o getting reactive and can manage my own experience w/o needing to process it with you. ideally, you're able to do the same. i'm past the point of needing to process a bunch of stuff in relationships. hopefully you are too. we'll process only that which needs to be processed together; the rest we'll each handle on our own. let's enjoy sharing the journey. harmony in relationship is absolutely paramount to me; life is short.  i'm a long time student (over 23 years) of the diamond approach in the ridhwan school and also of yoga. i have very very high integrity. i almost always take the high road- even in the worst of times. i'm iconoclastic, autodidactic, and very self-aware.  i live on the edge or beyond the edge of my comfort zone most of the time: my soul is on some sort of fast track. the rate of growth/transformation can be quite rapid; it's kind of out of my hands. i don't expect you to be like me in this regard, but you should know and understand this and be ok with it. i am not your average bear.  i'm realistic and i'm optimistic. i no longer sweat the small stuff and most things really are small stuff.  i am an independent thinker and think waaaay outside the box. visionary, creative, progressive,.....you get the idea.  my life is very full and fairly well-balanced; and i have plenty of time for the right man. in fact, it's a high priority for me to make time for a great man and create a great relationship together.  my spiritual life is quite significant, but the form is not rigid. i'm happier hiking, gardening, singing kirtan and bhajans, or going to a yoga class (all of those are spiritual for me) than going to church or temple although i can enjoy that too on occasion. my orientation to life is spiritual, has been my entire life and is well-integrated into my being so it's not critical for me to do spiritual things.  i'm quite self-sufficient, but much prefer partnership. i've gone from being super-competent, ultra-independent, feminist, do-everything-myself to being able to kindly ask for help, graciously accept it when it's offered, and be a feminine participant in the relationship. i'm very generous with the many feminine skills i possess. an ideal relationship for me has lots of mutual lavishing. interesting how when there's a lot of lavishing, there are very few issues....... :)  i know how to really accept another unconditionally and appreciate another fully. our chances for a really harmonious relationship increase tremendously if the same is true for you.  while having shared interests is nice, what is more important to me in a partner are kindness, self-acceptance, passion, respect, devotion to the relationship, personal responsibility, generosity, humor, lightness, fun, passion, honesty and openness. i offer all of these too.  i'm really comfortable with my sexuality as well as my libido. i'm also super affectionate and am extremely cuddly. if you are too, this could be delightful.  i'm active physically, love to hike, skate, walk, x/c ski, downhill too, snowshoe, swim, snorkel, love to dance- pretty much any kind of dance. if you'd be willing to take partner dance lessons, i'd be thrilled! i don't do any intense gym workouts, rock climb or do xtreme sports. and i'm not interested in competition.  i also enjoy quiet indoor time reading, writing, movies, sitting in front of the fire, and hanging out together, doing domestic stuff, cooking together, baking alone or together.  i'm told that although i'm quite mature, i have a youthfulness and appearance younger than my years. for this reason (and a few others), i stated my age 3 years younger than actual. people usually don't believe me when i tell them my age. really.  wrt the okc enneagram test, i am an unconventional 9 with an 8 wing; i am not an 8. i'd especially love to hear from men who are well-integrated 6s.  thanks for reading all the way through. i appreciate that it's a lot to read, but i find it saves us both a lot of time if we're really clear, self-revealing and specific.","being being a change agent being present aligned with flow in the universe practicing quantum physics stopping to smell the roses constantly learning new things, reading many different things/topics  entrepreneur, healer, teacher, writer, artist, half-time parent of an 18 year old (she's leaving at the end of summer). gardening, home repair, etc. (i welcome help/company in these activities! i suck at home repair tasks b/c i have no idea what to do and no skill/experience.).  doing my part to make the world a better place, being the change i want to see in the world, helping others to experience greater freedom, a greater sense of their soul's purpose, and greater fulfillment, joy and ease.","the stuff in the previous section  relationships. being authentic, individuated, and expressive. communicating constructively, compassionately and effectively. enjoying, appreciating, giving and receiving. relaxing into whatever arises. allowing it to unfold on it's own (ok, i'm not actually good at allowing the unfolding all of the time..... yet, but i'm steadfast in practicing allowing it).  inquiry, compassion, kindness, discerning what is true, articulating this, being real.  being resourceful and creative.  synthesizing seemingly disparate concepts and info. and explaining complex concepts in simple terms.  organic gardening  anything requiring spatial abilities (used to be an architect).  i'm a fabulous kisser, cuddler, and......  being a really good mom.  crafting and living my life in accordance with my values.  i'm really good with money, people, cats, plants.........  i very reluctantly admit to being a great cook b/c i don't cook that much anymore. however, i bake grain-free, sugar-free, gluten-free stuff that is seriously delicious and quite healthy.","my warm eyes, my smile, or my long legs if i'm wearing a dress or skirt;
